# Code Quality & Architecture

1. **Clean Code Standards**: Adhere strictly to SOLID and DRY principles. Code must be self-documenting, readable, and maintainable.
2. **No "God Objects" (Modularity)**: Strictly limit file size to 200-250 lines. If a file exceeds this limit, decompose it into smaller, focused modules or hooks immediately. This is crucial for architecture and indexing.
3. **English Comments**: All code comments and documentation must be written exclusively in English.

# Workflow & Logic

4. **Tech Stack Integrity**: Do not introduce new libraries or change the UI/CSS structure unless explicitly requested. Use existing components whenever possible.
5. **Token Efficiency**: Be concise. Avoid conversational fillers. Focus strictly on the logic implementation.
6. **Final Verification**: At the end of every task, explicitly cross-reference the result with the initial plan/requirements to ensure nothing was missed before confirming completion.
7. **Language Protocol**: Provide all conversational responses, explanations, and reasoning in **Russian**. However, all code, variable names, and comments within the code must remain strictly in **English**.
