# Project Context & Documentation

This directory stores the "Memory" of the project. Unlike `skills` (which describe *how* to do things), this folder describes *what* the project is, its constraints, and architectural decisions.

## Structure

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: High-level system design and constraints.
- `DECISIONS.md`: Log of key technical decisions (ADR - Architecture Decision Records).
